### Hi there 👋

I'm Billy, an iOS security researcher based in London, UK. 

I'm interested in all-things security - from low-level programming, to reverse engineering and exploit development. Here you will find various tools and random projects I've built over the past few years. Hopefully there's something here you'll find valuable!

Want to chat with me about one of my projects, or something else? You can reach me at billy@zygosec.com, or find me on:
